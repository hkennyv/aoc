# Advent of Code

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code (AOC) 2020. I'm taking
this year's AOC to sharpen my [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) skills.

**Bonus:** the whole repository is a cargo crate, and I've added the description
of each day's challenge to the crate description so you can view all all of the
challenges and all of the functions and their docstrings that I used.

To build the documentation, simply run:

```
cargo doc --workspace --open
```

And the documentation should automatically open up in your browser. Each of the
AOC days should appear in the left-hand sidebar as its own crate that you can
choose to view.

**WIP:** deploy rustdoc pages to github pages... coming soon (hopefully)!
